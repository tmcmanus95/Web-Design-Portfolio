# Web-Design-Portfolio

A website to showcase the apps I have developed.

This website contains the shell that will host the applications I plan to develop over the course of the web development bootcamp I cam currently enrolled in. It also features a brief description about my approach to web design and my emphasis on inclusivity. Finally, the website contains several links by which to contact me. These will be edited to reflect my actual contact information upon deployment of the aforementioned applications.
